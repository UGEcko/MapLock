# EnvMods
Welcome to EnvMods, a package (in beta) designed to make ReMapper environment statements and others more friendly, while also giving some helpful effects such as `despawn()` which will despawn the bts environment to make room for yours!  Tutorials/explanations for each function can be found in the [examples](https://github.com/Splashcard04/EnvMods/wiki/Examples) for this repo!  If you have any questions or would like to add to this repo dm me on discord @splashcard__#2121
